I'm an IT and Cyber Security professional working towards Cloud technologies. I test a lot of things in my homelab, mostly working with Linux, Virtualization, and Containerization ( Docker, Kubernetes, K3s ). My current short-term roadmap is ~~AWS Solutions Architect~~(complete), followed by SysOps and Developer associate.
