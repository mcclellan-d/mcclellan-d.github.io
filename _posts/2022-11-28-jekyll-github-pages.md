title: Deploy static website with Github Pages & Jekyll
date: 2022-11-1 01:40 -0600
categories: [web]
tags: [git, ci/cd, jekyll, github, ruby]
---

Tools & services used: [Jekyll, git, github, Github Pages, GitHub actions]

I used these tools to deploy this website! 

## What did I do?
- Installed Ruby & Jekyll
- Generated github repository with Chirpy Starter(Jekyll theme)
- Configured various files
- Committed changes via Git
- Launched website with GitHub actions

This was a great way to get introduced to static site generators, git, basic CI/CD. I used this project to get familiarized with Visual Studio Code and Git. Prior to this I've only used cloud9 and mainly used git to clone repos, not deploy to them.





Shout-out to Techno Tim for making a video about Jekyll, without him this process would've taken much longer.
